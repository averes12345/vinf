During childhood, hormone levels are low. During puberty, estrogen begins to fluctuate, followed by progesterone when you first begin ovulating. After 6-12 years the menstrual cycle normalizes into a rhythm during the menstrual years, barring any reproductive health issues or pregnancy and breastfeeding, which pauses the cycling. Perimenopause, similar to puberty, has high fluctuations of estrogen as progesterone slowly begins to decline. Eventually, you stop ovulating, reach menopause, and hormones return to childlike levels with low progesterone. Menopause is the time when menstrual periods permanently stop, marking the end of the reproductive stage for the female human. It typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, although the exact timing can vary. Menopause is usually a natural change related to a decrease in circulating blood estrogen levels. Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries, some types of chemotherapy, or anything that leads to a decrease in hormone levels.

{"canonical_url":"https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/anastrozole/common-questions-about-anastrozole/","nhs_title":"Common questions about anastrozole - NHS","nhs_description":"NHS medicines information on common questions about anastrozole.","nhs_body":"﻿\nCommon questions about anastrozole - NHS\nAnastrozole belongs to a group of medicines called aromatase inhibitors.Aromatase inhibitor medicines are used to treat or prevent certain types of breast cancer, where the cancer cells need oestrogen (a hormone) to grow.After the menopause your ovaries stop producing oestrogen. Your body still makes small amounts of oestrogen using an enzyme called aromatase, which changes hormones called androgens into oestrogen.Aromatase inhibitors reduce the amount of aromatase in your body and this stops your body producing oestrogen. This helps prevent cancer cells growing as they no longer have a source of oestrogen.\nHow long does it take to work?\nAnastrozole starts to reduce the amount of oestrogen in your body within 24 hours, but it takes several weeks or months for it to work fully.During this time, you're likely to have menopause symptoms as your body gets used to having less oestrogen. These symptoms will gradually improve as your body gets used to the medicine.\nAre there any long-term side effects?\nAnastrozole is generally safe to take long term. However, your specialist team will monitor your health carefully.This is because anastrozole reduces levels of oestrogen in your body. Your body needs oestrogen for strong and healthy bones. If you take anastrozole for a long time your bones can become weaker (osteoporosis) and may be more likely to break.You will have bone density (DEXA) scans before you start taking anastrozole, 1 or 2 years into treatment and again after you finish your treatment.Your doctor may recommend a type of medicine called a bisphosphonate to help reduce bone damage. They can also give you advice on exercise and diet to help keep your bones strong.Anastrozole can also increase your cholesterol levels. Your doctor will monitor this during your regular check-ups and recommend treatment if you need it.\nWhat will happen if I stop taking it?\nIf you want to stop taking anastrozole for any reason, your doctor will be able to discuss alternatives for treating your breast cancer or preventing it coming back.Sometimes people may have a short break from anastrozole. This can help if you're getting side effects such as joint pain. However, only take a break from your medicine if you've discussed it with your specialist first and they agree to it.\nImportant\nDo not stop taking anastrozole without talking to your doctor first.\nAre there other medicines like anastrozole?\nMedicines such as letrozole and exemestane work in a similar way to anastrozole. They are also aromatase inhibitors, and so they also lower your oestrogen level and can cause similar side effects.However, medicines affect people in different ways. If you're bothered by side effects from taking anastrozole, talk to your doctor. They may recommend one of these other medicines instead.\nWhat are the benefits of taking anastrozole?\nAnastrozole helps stop your breast cancer coming back after having treatment for cancer.The exact benefits and how well it's likely to work for you depend on a combination of different things.This varies for each person and includes factors like your age when the breast cancer was found, how it was found and whether you've had chemotherapy or not.Anastrozole can also be used to reduce the risk of breast cancer after the menopause if you have a medium or high risk of breast cancer because of your family history. Your specialist will discuss the likely benefits and risks of taking anastrozole to help prevent breast cancer.\nWill it affect my contraception?\nAnastrozole is generally only given to you if you've gone through the menopause.However, some people find that they start having periods again after taking anastrozole. If this happens to you, it's important to use reliable contraception.Talk to your doctor if your periods start again, or if there's any chance that you could be pregnant.Anastrozole is not recommended during pregnancy.\nCan I drive or ride a bike?\nSome people feel extremely tired when taking anastrozole.If you feel tired or dizzy, do not drive, cycle, or use tools or machinery until you feel OK again.It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking anastrozole. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\nCan I drink alcohol while taking anastrozole?\nThere's no evidence that drinking alcohol causes any problems when taking anastrozole.Some people taking anastrozole may get hot flushes or redness when they drink alcohol. In this case, avoiding alcohol may help.\nIs there any food or drink I need to avoid?\nMost people can eat and drink normally when taking anastrozole.Some people may get hot flushes or redness when they drink alcohol.Some people find anastrozole affects their appetite.If you lose your appetite, try to make sure you have a balanced diet. Try eating smaller meals more often instead of big meals.\nPage last reviewed: 6 March 2024\nNext review due: 6 March 2027","nhs_medicine_name":"anastrozole","related_conditions":[],"nhs_date_modified":"2024-04-10T19:01:00+00:00","source_path":"https___www.nhs.uk_medicines_anastrozole_common-questions-about-anastrozole_.html","http_status":200,"wiki":[{"wiki_join_type":"condition"},{"page_id":332389,"title":"Anastrozole","wiki_intro":"| tradename = Arimidex, Aremed, others | Drugs.com = | MedlinePlus = a696018 | DailyMedID = Anastrozole | pregnancy_AU = C | routes_of_administration = By mouth | class = Aromatase inhibitor; Antiestrogen | ATC_prefix = L02 | ATC_suffix = BG03 | ATC_supplemental =","wiki_infobox":[],"categories":["27-Hydroxylase inhibitors","Aromatase inhibitors","Drugs developed by AstraZeneca","Hormonal antineoplastic drugs","Nitriles","Peripherally selective drugs","Triazoles","World Health Organization essential medicines","Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate"],"wiki_join_type":"medicine"}],"doc_id":"https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/anastrozole/common-questions-about-anastrozole/"}
{"canonical_url":"https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/anticoagulants/considerations/","nhs_title":"Anticoagulant medicines - Considerations\n- NHS","nhs_description":"Read about the things you need to bear in mind if you","nhs_body":"﻿\nAnticoagulant medicines - Considerations\n- NHS\nIf you're prescribed anticoagulants, always follow the instructions of your GP or another healthcare professional.Some of the main issues you'll need to consider while taking your medicine are outlined below.\nHaving surgery\nIf you're taking anticoagulants and you need to have surgery or any kind of invasive procedure, make sure that the healthcare professionals treating you are aware of your medicine.This includes procedures used to diagnose other conditions, such as an endoscopy or cystoscopy.As anticoagulants reduce the ability of your blood to clot, there's a risk you could experience heavy bleeding if any kind of cut (incision) is made during a procedure.You may therefore be advised to stop taking your medicine before surgery.If you're having a dental procedure, such as having a tooth removed, tell your dentist that you take anticoagulants.You may not need to stop taking your medicine, but you might need to have a blood test before the procedure to make sure your blood clots at the right speed.Only stop taking your medicine on the advice of your GP or another healthcare professional.\nPregnancy\nWarfarin isn't normally given to pregnant women because it can affect the unborn baby.It can cause birth defects or excessive bleeding from the placenta or foetus.The newer anticoagulant medicines apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban also are not recommended in pregnancy.If you're taking any of these medicines, you should make sure you use contraception when having sex to avoid becoming pregnant.If you're on anticoagulants and find out you're pregnant or plan to start trying for a baby, speak to your GP or anticoagulant clinic about stopping or changing your prescription. Injections of an anticoagulant called heparin can be given while you're pregnant if necessary.
